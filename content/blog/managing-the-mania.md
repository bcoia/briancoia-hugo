I've spent several years of my life passively managing a [TrackMania](http://maniaplanet.com/trackmania/stadium) server for [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com).

Giant Bomb has a love-hate relationship with TrackMania. Jeff Gerstmann loves it, and nobody else on staff understands the appeal. Giant Bomb has fostered one of the few TrackMania communities that _does_ understand TrackMania's unique barely-interactive-yet-still-inherantly-engaging multiplayer gameplay, also known as the Mania.

I enable the Mania by hosting [Giant Bomb Unofficial Classic](http://redco.in/tm). This week was the fourth (or fifth? I've lost count) time I've revived it. This current iteration of the server is by far one of the most successful--at the time of this post, over 50 players are connected. It's the second most populated server in the world. Granted, there aren't many TrackMania 2 players to begin with.. But it's still fun to acknowledge.<!--more-->

== Building the Mania
Back in 2011, I was bored and in college. I recently got into the GiantBomb community and wanted to contribute. I saw the TrackMania community's appreciation of GiantBomb and wanted to make a server. So I did!

The first server was hosted off of my desktop and home internet connection, using (link: http://tmsiab.tmu-xrated.de/ text: TrackMania-Server-in-a-Box). It ran poorly, was difficult to customize, and forced me to leave my desktop on 24/7. The server software was unstable and needed almost daily restarts. I think this server was alive for, at most, two weeks.

The community loved it. It was almost always near its 50 player cap. It appeared in a few GiantBomb videos. The first stream that the server appeared in was the [September 29th, 2011 Thursday Night Throwdown](http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/thursday-night-throwdown-092911/2300-4980/), where you can find almost two solid hours of TrackMania 2 Canyon action.

Shortly after that stream, Jeff Gerstmann offered to take over the server. I was honored (and relieved) to pass the reins.

The server was migrated to a sketchy dedicated server host, to whom Jeff piped freshly-converted PayPal euros to on a monthly basis. This server was around for at least a few months, probably much longer.

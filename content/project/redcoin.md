[Redco.in](https://redco.in) is a personal gaming site and service for the servers and tools I host for my friends.

The Giant Bomb TrackMania 2 server featured in several videos [resides here](https://redco.in/tm). The site also serves as a front-end to a Mumble server, TT-RSS server, and several other tools underneath a LEMP stack.

[XIVTrack](http://xivtrack.sillydicemaze.net) is a tool for tracking the collectables you own in Final Fantasy XIV. Users can currently track minions, mounts and Triple Triad cards. All data is stored client-side, to avoid the need of a user management system.

[Ryan Cassidy](https://twitter.com/rycass) is the project lead. I helped with the design and layout.

The source and data are available on [Github](https://github.com/rycass/XIVTrack).

### Environment

The application is built on top of [AngularJS 1.5](https://angularjs.org/) with ample use of the [Smart Table plugin](https://github.com/lorenzofox3/Smart-Table). The design is built on top of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) with several built-in tweaks and customization options.

Hi, I'm Brian!

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from University of Wisconsin-Parkside. I have been around computers for most of my life, so I may as well make a career out of it, right?

I'm currently working at a small company as a web developer and occasional system admin. I'm focused on new Python/Flask projects, and support PHP legacy applications when necessary. When I'm not coding, I improve our hardware infrastructure, enhance security, and deploy devops and intranet tools. I'm somewhat obsessed with making everything report to [Slack](https://slack.com).

For fun, I manage game servers and stream myself playing games for the internet. I have been known to bring [the 'Mania](https://redco.in/tm) to popular gaming site [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com). I play dumb games psuedo-competitively; for example, I am the [Fun and Games Champion of Ultimate Fighting Game Tournament 10](https://twitter.com/redcoin/status/576183007997886464).

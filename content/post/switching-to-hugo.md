It's the year 2016.

I want to write about stuff. But I don't want to deal with my CMS, or PHP, or.. basically any part of my old stack.

[Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) is great and I still highly recommend it. But it's a CMS. I want a static site generator.

Static site generators are more powerful than ever before. And they're much easier to keep secure and under version control.

Anyways! I'm giving [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) a try.

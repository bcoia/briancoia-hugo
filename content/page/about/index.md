Hi, I'm Brian!

I've tinkered with computer hardware and software for most of my life. Since graduating with a Computer Science degree from University of Wisconsin-Parkside in 2014 (with a minor in Web Development), I dove headfirst into a career as a web developer.

I'm currently working at a [Fangamer](http://www.fangamer.com) as a Web Developer. I work on the Shopify front-end and various intranet tools and applications, largely developed in Ruby.

For fun, I manage game servers and stream myself playing games for the internet. I have been known to bring [the 'Mania](https://redco.in/tm) to popular gaming site [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com). I play dumb games psuedo-competitively; for example, I am the [Fun and Games Champion of Ultimate Fighting Game Tournament 10](https://twitter.com/redcoin/status/576183007997886464). I occasionally stream on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/redcoin).

My text editor of choice is [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). I work on an [2016 15" MacBook Pro](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.9-15-late-2016-retina-display-touch-bar-specs.html). I watch streams, store media and backups, and run virtual machines on a [2012 Mac Mini server](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i7-2.3-late-2012-server-specs.html). I play PC games on a [custom i7 6700k/GTX 1070 mITX desktop](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/b2KXJV). My current phone is a [matte black iPhone 7 Plus](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/iphone/specs/apple-iphone-7-plus-att-t-mobile-global-a1784-specs.html).

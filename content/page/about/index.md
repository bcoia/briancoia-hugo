Hi, I'm Brian!

I've tinkered with computer hardware and software for most of my life. Since graduating with a Computer Science degree from University of Wisconsin-Parkside in 2014 (with a minor in Web Development), I dove headfirst into a career as a web developer.

I'm currently working at a [Fangamer](http://www.fangamer.com) as a Web Developer. I work on the Shopify front-end and various intranet tools and applications, largely developed in Ruby and modern JavaScript.

For fun, I manage game servers and stream myself playing games for the internet. I have been known to bring [the 'Mania](https://redco.in/tm) to popular gaming site [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com). I play dumb games psuedo-competitively; for example, I am the [Fun and Games Champion of Ultimate Fighting Game Tournament 10](https://twitter.com/redcoin/status/576183007997886464). I occasionally stream on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/redcoin).

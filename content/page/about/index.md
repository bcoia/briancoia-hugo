Hi, I'm Brian!

I've tinkered with computer hardware and software for most of my life. Since graduating with a Computer Science degree from University of Wisconsin-Parkside in 2014 (with a minor in Web Development), I dove headfirst into a career as a web developer. Technically, you could call me a 'full stack developer'. [I'd really prefer you don't](https://medium.com/swlh/the-full-stack-developer-is-a-myth-4e3fb9c25867#.4wb61hat3).

I'm currently working at a small company as a web developer and occasional system admin. I'm focused on new Python/Flask projects, and support PHP legacy applications when necessary. When I'm not coding, I improve our server infrastructure, harden security, and deploy devops and intranet tools. I'm somewhat obsessed with making everything report to [Slack](https://slack.com).

For fun, I manage game servers and stream myself playing games for the internet. I have been known to bring [the 'Mania](https://redco.in/tm) to popular gaming site [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com). I play dumb games psuedo-competitively; for example, I am the [Fun and Games Champion of Ultimate Fighting Game Tournament 10](https://twitter.com/redcoin/status/576183007997886464). I occasionally stream on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/redcoin).

My text editor of choice is [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). I work on an [early 2015 13" retina MacBook Pro](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/index-macbookpro.html). I watch streams, store media and backups, and run virtual machines on a [2012 Mac Mini server](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i7-2.3-late-2012-server-specs.html). I play PC games on a [custom i7 2700k/GTX 970 desktop](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/bcoia/saved/Gf6TwP). My current phone is a [space gray iPhone 6](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/iphone/specs/apple-iphone-6-a1549-4.7-inch-gsm-north-america-specs.html).
